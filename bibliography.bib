In this work we present a novel automated system to generate poetry in Basque language conditioned by non-local constraints. From a given corpus two Markov chains representing forward and backward 2-grams are built. From these Markov chains and a semantic model, a system able to generate poems conforming a given metric and following semantic cues has been designed. The user is prompted to input a theme for the poem and also a seed word to start the generating process. The system produces several poems in less than a minute, enough for using it in live events.},

	abstract = { For a unimodal distribution on the real line, the celebrated mean-median-mode inequality states that they often occur in an alphabetical (or its reverse) order. Various sufficient conditions for the validity of the inequality are known. This article explicitly characterizes the three dimensional set of means, medians, and modes of unimodal distributions. It is found that the set is pathwise connected but not convex. Some fundamental inequalities among the mean, the median and mode of unimodal distributions are also derived. These inequalities are used: (i) to prove nonunimodality of certain distributions, and (ii) for obtaining bounds on the median of a unimodal distribution. In a multivariate setting, the generalized notion of \$\alpha\$-unimodality is used, and characterizations are given for the set of mean vectors, when the mode is fixed, or when it varies in a sphere. In particular, it is found that the set of mean vectors for generalized unimodal distributions with a specified mode and covariance matrix is an exact ellipsoid and this ellipsoid is explicitly described. }

	abstract = {The present thesis introduces Clifford Algebra as a framework for neural computation. Clifford Algebra subsumes the reals, complex numbers and quaternions. Neural computation with Clifford algebras is model--based. This principle is established by constructing Clifford algebras from quadratic spaces. Then the subspace grading inherent to any Clifford algebra is introduced, which allows the representation of different geometric entities like points, lines, and so on. The above features of Clifford algebras are then taken as motivation for introducing the Basic Clifford Neuron (BCN), which is solely based on the geometric product of the underlying Clifford algebra. Using BCNs the Linear Associator is generalized to the Clifford associator. As a second type of Clifford neuron the Spinor Clifford Neuron (SCN) is presented. The propagation function of a SCN is an orthogonal transformation. Examples of how Clifford neurons can be used advantageously are given, including the linear computation of M{\"o}bius transformations by a SCN. A systematic basis for Clifford neural computation is provided by the important notions of isomorphic Clifford neurons and isomorphic representations. After the neuron level is established, the discussion continues with (Spinor) Clifford Multilayer Perceptrons. The treatment is divided into two parts according to the type of activation function used. First, (Spinor) Clifford Multilayer Perceptrons with real-valued activation functions ((S)CMLPs) are studied. A generic Backpropagation algorithm for CMLPs is derived. Also, universal approximation theorems for (S)CMLPs are presented. The efficency of (S)CMLPs is shown in a couple of simulations. Finally, the class of Clifford Multilayer Perceptrons with Clifford-valued activation functions is studied.},

	abstract = {Reviews "This new book by Hend Dawood is a fresh introduction to some of the basics of interval computation. It stops short of discussing the more complicated subdivision methods for converging to ranges of values, however it provides a bit of perspective about complex interval arithmetic, constraint intervals, and modal intervals, and it does go into the design of hardware operations for interval arithmetic, which is something still to be done by computer manufacturers." - Ramon E. Moore, (The Founder of Interval Computations) Professor Emeritus of Computer and Information Science, Department of Mathematics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, U.S.A. "I am delighted to see one more Egyptian citizen re-entering the field of interval mathematics invented in this very country thousands years ago." - Marek W. Gutowski, Institute of Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warszawa, Poland Book Description Scientists are, all the time, in a struggle with uncertainty which is always a threat to a trustworthy scientific knowledge. A very simple and natural idea, to defeat uncertainty, is that of enclosing uncertain measured values in real closed intervals. On the basis of this idea, interval arithmetic is constructed. The idea of calculating with intervals is not completely new in mathematics: the concept has been known since Archimedes, who used guaranteed lower and upper bounds to compute his constant Pi. Interval arithmetic is now a broad field in which rigorous mathematics is associated with scientific computing. This connection makes it possible to solve uncertainty problems that cannot be efficiently solved by floating-point arithmetic. Today, application areas of interval methods include electrical engineering, control theory, remote sensing, experimental and computational physics, chaotic systems, celestial mechanics, signal processing, computer graphics, robotics, and computer-assisted proofs. The purpose of this book is to be a concise but informative introduction to the theories of interval arithmetic as well as to some of their computational and scientific applications.}

These include data-gathering methods (informal anecdotes, case studies, observational studies, and experiments) and methods of analysis (exploratory and confirmatory data analysis, special analytic techniques, and probabilistic modeling, both general and special purpose). We develop a version of the birthday problem general enough to include dependence, inhomogeneity, and almost multiple matches. We review Fisher’s techniques for giving partial credit for close matches. We develop a model for studying coincidences involving newly learned words. Once we set aside coincidences having apparent causes, four principles account for large numbers of remaining coincidences: hidden cause; psychology, including memory and perception; multiplicity of endpoints, including the counting of “close” or nearly alike events as if they were identical; and the law of truly large numbers which says that when enormous numbers of events and people and their interactions cumulate over time, almost any outrageous event is bound to occur. These sources account for much of the force of synchronicity.},

	abstract = {The topic of preferences is a new branch of machine learning and data mining, and it has attracted considerable attention in artificial intelligence research in previous years. It involves learning from observations that reveal information about the preferences of an individual or a class of individuals. Representing and processing knowledge in terms of preferences is appealing as it allows one to specify desires in a declarative way, to combine qualitative and quantitative modes of reasoning, and to deal with inconsistencies and exceptions in a flexible manner. And, generalizing beyond training data, models thus learned may be used for preference prediction. This is the first book dedicated to this topic, and the treatment is comprehensive. The editors first offer a thorough introduction, including a systematic categorization according to learning task and learning technique, along with a unified notation. The first half of the book is organized into parts on label ranking, instance ranking, and object ranking; while the second half is organized into parts on applications of preference learning in multiattribute domains, information retrieval, and recommender systems. The book will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in artificial intelligence, in particular machine learning and data mining, and in fields such as multicriteria decision-making and operations research.}

Our approach takes advantage of the combination of Markov Chains and word embeddings to produce high-quality data similar to an initial dataset. In contrast to other neural-based generative methods, it does not need a high amount of training data. Results showhow our approach can generate useful data for NLP tools. In particular, we validate our approach by building Transformer-based Language Models using data from three different domains in the context of enriching general purpose chatbots.},

But neither associative nor nonassociative algebra structure satisfying a natural property on the product of intervals can be denned on this vector space. We define an embedding of this vector space into a 4-dimensional associative algebra and we compute all the arithmetic operations on intervals in this algebra. As applications, we study polynomial functions and the problem of diagonalization of matrices whose elements are intervals.},

	abstract = {An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance to marketing to astrophysics in the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform. Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.}

Among these cutting-edge AI technologies, Generative AI has emerged as a promising instrument with the potential to empower educators and students through innovative instructional strategies. This article aims to investigate the various applications of Generative AI in education and cast light on its role in shaping the future of education. The objectives of this study are twofold: first, to investigate the various instructional strategies that can be enhanced by employing Generative AI, and second, to assess the potential impact of these strategies on student learning outcomes. To accomplish these goals, a comprehensive literature review was conducted analyzing existing studies and applications of Generative AI in educational settings. The results and discussions emphasize the numerous educational benefits of Generative AI. Educators can personalize learning experiences, create interactive content, and facilitate adaptive assessments by leveraging the capabilities of Generative AI. This individualized strategy has the potential to boost learner engagement and knowledge retention. However, despite the numerous advantages, ethical concerns and difficulties arise. The responsible incorporation of Generative AI in education requires addressing issues such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the educator’s role in directing AI-driven learning experiences. The research concludes by emphasizing that Generative AI holds enormous promise for empowering education and transforming instructional practices. The findings highlight the importance of ongoing collaboration between educators, policymakers, and AI developers to ensure the ethical and equitable integration of Generative AI into educational environments. By embracing the potential of Generative AI while remaining vigilant regarding its challenges, the field of education can unlock novel opportunities to nurture an inclusive, adaptive, and learner-centric pedagogical landscape for tomorrow’s learners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;},

	ABSTRACT = {Recent RNN models deal with various dimensions of MTS as independent channels, which may lead to the loss of dependencies between different dimensions or the loss of associated information between each dimension and the global. To process MTS in a holistic way without losing the inter-relationship among dimensions, this paper proposes a novel Long-and Short-term Time-series network based on geometric algebra (GA), dubbed GA-LSTNet. Specifically, taking advantage of GA, multi-dimensional data at each time point of MTS is represented as GA multi-vectors to capture the inherent structures and preserve the correlation of those dimensions. In particular, traditional real-valued RNN, real-valued LSTM, and the back-propagation through time are extended to the GA domain. We evaluate the performance of the proposed GA-LSTNet model in prediction tasks on four well-known MTS datasets, and compared the prediction performance with other six methods. The experimental results indicate that our GA-LSTNet model outperforms traditional real-valued LSTNet with higher prediction accuracy, providing a more accurate solution for the existing shortcomings of MTS prediction models.}

We present novel evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric can systematically lead to errors. We demonstrate false alarms (i.e., detecting an effect where none exists, Type I errors) and failures to detect effects (i.e., loss of power, Type II errors). We demonstrate systematic inversions of effects, for which treating ordinal data as metric indicates the opposite ordering of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same problems — false alarms, misses, and inversions — for interactions in factorial designs and for trend analyses in regression. We demonstrate that averaging across multiple ordinal measurements does not solve or even ameliorate these problems. A central contribution is a graphical explanation of how and when the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that there is no sure-fire way to detect these problems by treating the ordinal values as metric, and instead we advocate use of ordered-probit models (or similar) because they will better describe the data. Finally, although frequentist approaches to some ordered-probit models are available, we use Bayesian methods because of their flexibility in specifying models and their richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates. An R script is provided for running an analysis that compares ordered-probit and metric models.}

Recently, tools that leverage LLMs have made their way into the classroom where they help students generate code and help instructors generate learning materials. There are likely many more uses of these tools -- both beneficial to learning and possibly detrimental to learning. To help ensure that these tools are used to enhance learning, educators need to not only be familiar with these tools, but with their use and potential misuse. The goal of this BoF is to raise awareness about LLMs and to build a learning community around their use in computing education. Aligned with this goal of building an inclusive learning community, our BoF is led by globally distributed discussion leaders, including undergraduate researchers, to facilitate multiple coordinated discussions that can lead to a broader conversation about the role of LLMs in CS education.},

On the other hand, quantitative modeling indicates that some “ultraconserved” words exist that might be used to find evidence for deep linguistic relationships beyond that time barrier. Here we use a statistical model, which takes into account the frequency with which words are used in common everyday speech, to predict the existence of a set of such highly conserved words among seven language families of Eurasia postulated to form a linguistic superfamily that evolved from a common ancestor around 15,000 y ago. We derive a dated phylogenetic tree of this proposed superfamily with a time-depth of ∼14,450 y, implying that some frequently used words have been retained in related forms since the end of the last ice age. Words used more than once per 1,000 in everyday speech were 7- to 10-times more likely to show deep ancestry on this tree. Our results suggest a remarkable fidelity in the transmission of some words and give theoretical justification to the search for features of language that might be preserved across wide spans of time and geography.},

	ABSTRACT = {This study focuses on the potential of generative artificial intelligence tools in education, particularly through the practical application of the 4PADAFE instructional design matrix. The objective was to evaluate how these tools, in combination with the matrix, can enhance education and improve the teaching&ndash;learning process. Through surveys conducted with teachers from the University of ESPE Armed Forces who participated in the MOOC course &ldquo;Generative Artificial Intelligence Tools for Education: GPT Chat Techniques&rdquo;, the study explores the impact of these tools on education. The findings reveal that generative artificial intelligence tools are crucial in developing massive MOOC virtual classrooms when integrated with an instructional design matrix. The results demonstrate the potential of generative artificial intelligence tools in university education. By utilizing these tools in conjunction with an instructional design matrix, educators can design and deliver personalized and enriching educational experiences. The devices offer opportunities to enhance the teaching&ndash;learning process and tailor educational materials to individual needs, ultimately preparing students for the demands of the 21st century. The study concludes that generative artificial intelligence tools have significant potential in education. They provide innovative ways to engage students, adapt content, and promote personalized learning. Implementing the 4PADAFE instructional design matrix further enhances the effectiveness and coherence of educational activities. By embracing these technological advancements, education can stay relevant and effectively meet the digital world&rsquo;s challenges.},

	abstract = {This article explores the natural language generation capabilities of large language models with application to the production of two types of learning resources common in programming courses. Using OpenAI Codex as the large language model, we create programming exercises (including sample solutions and test cases) and code explanations, assessing these qualitatively and quantitatively. Our results suggest that the majority of the automatically generated content is both novel and sensible, and in some cases ready to use as is. When creating exercises we find that it is remarkably easy to influence both the programming concepts and the contextual themes they contain, simply by supplying keywords as input to the model. Our analysis suggests that there is significant value in massive generative machine learning models as a tool for instructors, although there remains a need for some oversight to ensure the quality of the generated content before it is delivered to students. We further discuss the implications of OpenAI Codex and similar tools for introductory programming education and highlight future research streams that have the potential to improve the quality of the educational experience for both teachers and students alike.},

	abstract = {Markov models are one of the widely used techniques in machine learning to process natural language. Markov Chains and Hidden Markov Models are stochastic techniques employed for modeling systems that are dynamic and where the future state relies on the current state. The Markov chain, which generates a sequence of words to create a complete sentence, is frequently used in generating natural language. The hidden Markov model is employed in named-entity recognition and the tagging of parts of speech, which tries to predict hidden tags based on observed words. This paper reviews Markov models' use in three applications of natural language processing (NLP): natural language generation, named-entity recognition, and parts of speech tagging. Nowadays, researchers try to reduce dependence on lexicon or annotation tasks in NLP. In this paper, we have focused on Markov Models as a stochastic approach to process NLP. A literature review was conducted to summarize research attempts with focusing on methods/techniques that used Markov Models to process NLP, their advantages, and disadvantages. Most NLP research studies apply supervised models with the improvement of using Markov models to decrease the dependency on annotation tasks. Some others employed unsupervised solutions for reducing dependence on a lexicon or labeled datasets.},
